IscTransformer
===============

The ``IscTransformer`` class provides access to an IPSA transformer, to set and get data values and to retrieve load flow and fault level results. **Note that in IPSA a transformer is modelled as a combination of a branch and a tap changer. Therefore the transformer impedance data is stored in a branch instance and functions such as** ``GetLineDValue()`` **are used to access branch type data.**
