IscPlugin
============

The ``IscPlugin`` class provides access to an IPSA plugin, to set and get data values and assign the plugin to a component. To use the functions in this section an ``IscPlugin`` plugin object must be created from the ``CreatePlugin`` function of the ``IscNetwork`` class. One such object should be created each time a plugin is to be assigned to a network component. The sequence of operations is as follows:

    1. Create an ``IscPlugin`` from the ``CreatePlugin`` function of ``IscNetwork``

        a. The plugin name should be obtained from the plugin documentation
    2. Set the ``ControlledUID`` field value to the UID of the component that the plugin is to be assigned to
    3. Set the ``Plugin`` field value of the component itself to the UID of the plugin created in step 1
    4. The plugin parameters can now be set using the normal ``SetIntParameterValue`` function calls etc

    a. Note that the ``Set...``/``Get...`` functions are used only to get and set ``IscPlugin`` **field values** such as ``Name`` and ``Type``

Refer to the documentation provided with each plugin to determine the usage and parameter values available.
